# Document Analysis
# note: the pound sign is the syntax for writing a comment in RelaxNG — similar in function to
# <!-- comment --> in XML. Most coding languages have comments, but the syntax differs.

# recall from your "What is XML?" reading:  http://dh.obdurodon.org/what-is-xml.xhtml
# "Every digital humanities project begins with document analysis, where we determine 
# those aspects of the inherent hierarchical structure(s) of our documents that we wish 
# to use for research. If we are able to identify a useful hierarchical structure, the 
# next step is to mark up or encode our document to make that hierarchy accessible to a computer."

# There is no limit to what you can mark up in XML, which means that your decisions
# about what to capture ought to be deliberate and follow from your research questions.

# The *schema* is a great place to record your *document analysis*, i.e. notes about
# what different elements and attributes are intended to capture, why you chose them, etc.
# You will most likely have many XML documents, but perhaps only one schema to set rules
# for all of them. Therefore, writing your schema, and thinking through document analysis,
# can be one and the same process.

# Your task for today's recidtation is to get started on that process. You can begin to write
# out the RelaxNG code itself, but the main point is to record your reasoning (you can figure out
# the specific syntax later).

# For intance: "Each document must be composed of one or more paragraphs." 
# Or: "All words must be classified as a part of speach: verb, or noun, or adjective, or adverb."
# Or: "All <location/> elements must have a unique location ID attribute value, which
# corresponds to geographic coordinates."

# Again, the main point of this exercise is discussion with your teammates: what information
# do we wish to capture from the documents in our coprus, why, and how will we model that
# information in XML?


# EXAMPLE

# our corpus will contain many documents, so we decided to name our root element "document"
start = document

# each document contains metadata (general information specific to that document)
# as well as the primary text itself, which we are calling "body" for body text
document = element document { meta, body }

    # for each document, we must have information about author and publication date;
    # information about place of publication is optional because sometimes we do not have
    # that information but still wish to include the document in the corpus
    meta = element meta { author+, pub_date, pub_place? }
    
        # there can be one or more authors of a given text
        author = element author { text }
        
        # we are using the special date datatype (which restricts attribute value  to 
        # YYYY-MM-DD format) for this attribute value
        pub_date = element pub_date { xsd:date }
        
        
        pub_place = element pub_place { text }



    body = element body { text }
